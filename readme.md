build your own grep(basic):

 **commands** :
    -n  :  find the number of lines that matches the given string/pattern 
    -i  : The -i option enables to search for a string case insensitively in the given file. It matches the words like “linuX”, “LInux”, “linux”.  
    -w : total line if it is found as a substring in a file.
    -o : to display only the matched string by using the -o option. 
     -v :  display the lines that are not matched with the specified search string pattern using the -v option.
